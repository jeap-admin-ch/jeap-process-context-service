    shortDescription: Service template library for observing distributed business processes in event-driven architectures without central orchestration.
    longDescription: >
      The jEAP Process Context Service enables microservices to share and maintain a distributed view
      of long-running business processes. Instead of using a central process engine, it applies a
      choreography-based approach where process definitions are modeled as JSON templates. These templates
      specify tasks, milestones, correlations, and completion conditions. The service observes domain events
      from Kafka, correlates them to process instances, updates process state, and triggers events when
      milestones are reached or processes complete. It also supports advanced features such as optional and
      conditional task instantiation, process data correlation, relation tracking between business objects,
      and snapshot creation for auditability. Integrated with jEAP Messaging, it provides
      both runtime monitoring via a UI and REST APIs, and generates process events for downstream consumers,
      enabling transparency, traceability, and analytics across distributed systems.
    features:
      - JSON-based process templates with tasks, milestones, and correlation rules
      - Event-driven state tracking, milestone events, and process completion handling
      - Support for process snapshots, relation patterns, and UI-based process monitoring
      - Extensible using a plugin system
