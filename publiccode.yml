    shortDescription: Service template to store and retrieve process context information for audit or business requirements.
    longDescription: >
      The jEAP Process Context Service enables microservices to share and maintain a distributed view
      of long-running business processes. Instead of using a central process engine, it applies a
      choreography-based approach where process definitions are modeled as JSON templates. These templates
      specify tasks, correlations, and completion conditions. The service observes domain events
      from Kafka, correlates them to process instances, updates process state, and triggers events when
      processes are started or completed. It also supports advanced features such as optional and
      conditional task instantiation, process data correlation, relation tracking between business objects,
      and snapshot creation for auditability. Integrated with jEAP Messaging, it provides
      both runtime monitoring via a UI and REST APIs, and generates process events for downstream consumers,
      enabling transparency, traceability, and analytics across distributed systems. 
      A service instance can be created by depending on this template, then adding specific configuration and extending 
      it with plugin implementations.
    features:
      - JSON-based process templates with tasks, data, relations and correlation rules
      - Event-driven state tracking and process completion handling
      - Support for process snapshots, relation patterns, and UI-based process monitoring
      - Extensible using a plugin system
